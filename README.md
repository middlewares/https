Middleware to redirect to `https` if the request is `http` and add the [Strict Transport Security](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_Strict_Transport_Security) header to protect against protocol downgrade attacks and cookie hijacking.

## Requirements

* PHP >= 7.0
* A [PSR-7 http library](https://github.com/middlewares/awesome-psr15-middlewares#psr-7-implementations)
* A [PSR-15 middleware dispatcher](https://github.com/middlewares/awesome-psr15-middlewares#dispatcher)

## Installation

This package is installable and autoloadable via Composer as [middlewares/https](https://packagist.org/packages/middlewares/https).

```sh
composer require middlewares/https
```

## Example

```php
$dispatcher = new Dispatcher([
	(new Middlewares\Https())
		->includeSubdomains()
]);

$response = $dispatcher->dispatch(new ServerRequest());
```

## Options

#### `maxAge(int $maxAge)`

`max-age` directive for the `Strict-Transport-Security` header. By default is `31536000` (1 year).

#### `includeSubdomains(bool $includeSubdomains = true)`

Set `true` to add the `includeSubDomains` directive to the `Strict-Transport-Security` header (`false` by default)

#### `preload(bool $preload = true)`

Set `true` to add the `preload` directive to the `Strict-Transport-Security` header (`false` by default)

#### `checkHttpsForward(bool $checkHttpsForward = true)`

If it's `true` and the request contains the headers `X-Forwarded-Proto: https` or `X-Forwarded-Port: 443`, no redirection is returned. This prevent problems with Https load balancer.

#### `redirect(bool $redirect = true)`

Enabled (`true`) or disable (`false`) redirecting all together.

#### `responseFactory(Psr\Http\Message\ResponseFactoryInterface $responseFactory)`

A PSR-17 factory to create the redirect response.
